* Thanks

  To [[https://github.com/trockenasche/fdf2csv][trockenasche]] for starting this project. It seems that the original
  author todo-s have been fully implemented.

* General

  FDF is the original [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Forms][PDF forms data (only) submission format]]. This script
  converts such files to the popular CSV "spreadsheet" format. It should be
  easy to execute this script on multiple identical format FDF files, to
  build a large single CSV.

* Usage

  fdf2csv.py filename[#*.fdf]

  Adds row/data to the outaput filename.csv if it exists. It is assumed that
  the FDF fields are unique; They would become the CSV column names.

  The input filename can include the file path (with a leading tilde for
  home page). The output CSV has the trailing digits removed.
